# lens-expressplan (Stub)

> **This is a stub.** Load and execute the full prompt from the Lens module.
> When appropriate, use `vscode_askQuestions` to collect user input before continuing.

FIRST, run the preflight gate from the workspace root:

```bash
$PYTHON _bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-preflight/scripts/light-preflight.py --caller lens-expressplan
```

If that command exits non-zero, stop and surface the failure. Do not proceed.

ONLY AFTER a successful prompt-start sync, load and follow the module prompt at
`_bmad/lens-work/prompts/lens-expressplan.prompt.md`.
