FIRST, run the preflight gate from the workspace root:

```bash
python3 lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/bmad-lens-preflight/scripts/light-preflight.py
```

If that command exits non-zero, stop and surface the failure. Do not proceed.

ONLY AFTER a successful prompt-start sync, load and follow the module prompt at
`lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/prompts/lens-expressplan.prompt.md`.
