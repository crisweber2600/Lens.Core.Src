---

## Source Branch Analysis

### Branch 1: `origin/main` (Baseline)

**Philosophy:** Core orchestration infrastructure with lean workflows

**Unique Features:**
- ✅ Core phase lifecycle automation (`start-workflow`, `finish-workflow`, `phase-lifecycle`)
- ✅ Router workflows for phase transitions (`pre-plan`, `spec`, `plan`, `review`, `dev`)
- ✅ Four core agents (Compass, Casey, Scout, Tracey) with event-driven logic
- ✅ Utility workflows (`status`, `resume`, `sync`, `fix-state`, `override`, `archive`, `bootstrap`)
- ✅ Advanced workflows (`batch-process`, `check-repos`, `migrate-state`, `onboarding`, `setup-rollback`, `fix-story`, `switch`)
- ✅ Include files (`lane-topology`, `jira-integration`, `gate-event-template`, `pr-links`, `docs-path`, `artifact-validator`)
- ✅ Basic installer (`installer.js` with Node.js fs module)
- ✅ Phase-aware state management (`state.yaml` architecture)
- ✅ `module.yaml` with workflow categories, install questions, branch patterns

**File Count:** ~40 workflow files, 4 agents, 1 installer, 6 includes, 1 module config

---

### Branch 2: `lens-migration`

**Philosophy:** Deep discovery and comprehensive documentation

**Unique Features:**
- ✅ **Deep Discovery Workflows** (NOT in main):
  - `analyze-codebase/` with 3-step cascade (steps-c/)
  - `discover/` with 4-step process (steps-c/)
  - `generate-docs/` with structured doc generation (steps-c/)
  - `lens-sync/` with state reconciliation (steps-c/)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation Suite**:
  - `branch-protection.md` — Merge gate rules and branch topology
  - `feature-brief.md` — Product vision and personas
  - `implementation-context.md` — Technical architecture deep dive
  - `planning-spec.md` — Event-driven orchestration design
  - `project-brief.md` — High-level module overview
  - `workflows.md` — Complete workflow reference
  - `reviews/` directory structure
- ✅ Enhanced specs for `git-lifecycle`, `init-initiative`, `phase-commands`, `manual-operations`
- ✅ Detailed agent specs with branch topology diagrams
- ✅ `router/init-initiative/` workflow (supersedes core version)

**File Count:** +4 discovery workflows (16 step files), +7 comprehensive docs, enhanced specs

**Key Differentiator:** This branch was documentation-rich and discovery-focused, providing the paper trail and deep analysis capabilities that main lacked.

---

### Branch 3: `origin/codex/edit-lens-work-module`

**Philosophy:** Enhanced installer and module metadata

**Unique Features:**
- ✅ **Enhanced Installer** (`installer.js`):
  - Uses `fs-extra` instead of raw Node.js fs (copy, ensureDir, pathExists)
  - Adds `chalk` for colored console output
  - Copies `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to target workspace
  - Additional install question: `lens.base_branch_protection`
- ✅ **Module.yaml enhancements**:
  - More detailed install questions with validation
  - Enhanced descriptions and defaults
- ✅ Spec refinements in agents and workflows

**File Count:** 1 enhanced installer, refined module.yaml, spec improvements

**Key Differentiator:** This branch focused on installation and setup experience, making the module easier to adopt and configure.

## Branch Topology (Final State)

```
{domain}/{initiative_id}/
├── base                    # Main integration branch
├── small                   # Fast iteration lane (P1–P2)
│   ├── p1/w/{workflow}    # Analysis phase workflows
│   └── p2/w/{workflow}    # Planning phase workflows
└── large                   # Architecture review lane (P3)
    └── p3/w/{workflow}    # Solutioning phase workflows
```
