# Lens Workbench

LENS lifecycle workbench for feature context switching, initialization, planning, governance, and Auspex topology/reporting workflows.

Auspex is the preferred Lens workflow for organic, multi-feature knowledge work: Two-Tree topology, derived maps, living ledgers, Salmon impact, audits, and stakeholder reporting. The legacy domain, service, and feature commands remain available for direct scaffold and lifecycle operations.

## Commands

| Command | Code | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| /switch | SW | Switch the active Lens feature context |
| /lens-auspex-map-audit | AXA | Audit topology, stable IDs, parent refs, ledgers, and projection readiness |
| /lens-auspex-topology-design | AXT | Design or update Two-Tree program, domain, and service topology |
| /lens-auspex-reporting-snapshot | AXR | Create read-only stakeholder status snapshots |
| /new-feature | NF | Create a new feature with the feature initializer skill |
| /new-domain | ND | Create a new domain scaffold and register it with Lens |
| /new-service | NS | Create a new service scaffold within a domain |
| /help | HP | Show contextual command guidance |
| /next | NX | Route to the single best next lifecycle action |
