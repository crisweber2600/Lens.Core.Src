## Prompt Publication Surface

The active prompt family is the published `lens-*.prompt.md` surface declared in `module.yaml`.

Representative prompts:

- `lens-preplan.prompt.md`
- `lens-businessplan.prompt.md`
- `lens-techplan.prompt.md`
- `lens-finalizeplan.prompt.md`
- `lens-expressplan.prompt.md`
- `lens-dev.prompt.md`
- `lens-complete.prompt.md`
- `lens-discover.prompt.md`
- `lens-quickplan.prompt.md`

Legacy `lens-work.*` prompt aliases are not part of the active publication surface.

## Generated Adapter Surfaces

| Adapter | Generated Files |
|---------|-----------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/agents/`, `.github/prompts/`, `.github/skills/`, `lens-work-instructions.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/commands/` |
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/` |
| Codex | `.codex/commands/`, `AGENTS.md` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/commands/` |

All generated adapters must stay aligned with:

- `_bmad/lens-work/module.yaml`
- `_bmad/lens-work/_module-installer/installer.js`
- `_bmad/lens-work/scripts/install.py`
