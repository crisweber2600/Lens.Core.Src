# /lens-core-bugfix

## Overview

`/lens-core-bugfix` is a single-core-bug execution flow for direct implementation.
It captures one bug report, records a governance bug artifact, and then delegates
implementation to quick-dev in the target project.

This skill is a thin conductor. It orchestrates inputs and delegation only.

## Non-Negotiables

- Revert any no-implicit-commit behavior for this flow: if this run writes changes in a touched repo, commit and push them before final response.
- Never leave implementation, governance, or control-repo changes uncommitted as a manual handoff.
- Never tell the user to commit, push, or open the PR themselves when the required automation commands are available.
- The complete target-project workflow is mandatory: checkout/pull base, create the fresh Core Bugfix branch from the base branch for this bug, implement, validate, commit, push, create or reuse the PR for this bug branch, document the changes, and close the Core Bugfix bug artifact.
- The conductor completion gate (step 8) must be run by the conductor immediately after `bmad-quick-dev` presents its summary — do not wait for user input. `bmad-quick-dev` step-05 always ends by offering to push/create a PR; that offer is superseded by this conductor's mandatory git workflow. Proceed directly to step 8 when the delegate returns.
- Never delegate push, PR creation, `record-quickdev-pr`, or `close-quickdev-bug` to `bmad-quick-dev`. The conductor always runs these steps directly from the workspace root after the delegate returns.
- A successful `/lens-core-bugfix` run requires all of the following to be non-empty and verified: `working_branch`, `commit hash`, `PR URL`, and `bug_artifact_path` (under `bugs/Fixed/`).
- No-op completion is not allowed for this flow. If implementation produces no staged code changes, stop with a structured blocker (`bugfix_no_changes`) and do not report success.
- Every distinct bug must use its own branch created from the base branch. Do not infer continuation from recent conversation history, the current git branch, a previous Output Contract, or an open PR from another bug.
- Never create, add, remove, or use a sibling git worktree for this flow. Do not run `git worktree add`. Do not run `git worktree remove`. Do not switch implementation to another local clone or worktree as recovery. If `{target_project}` is dirty or `prepare-dev-branch` exits non-zero, stop and surface the exact error. Only continue in the canonical `{target_project}` path after explicit user approval to preserve unrelated edits and after `prepare-dev-branch` succeeds there.
- Prompt-start preflight and cloud-agent cleanup steps do not auto-clean `{target_project}`. Dirty target repos can still happen (for example from interrupted or user-local edits) and must be treated as hard blockers until explicitly approved by the user.

## Required Inputs

Collect these fields before execution:

- `title`
- `description`
- `repro_steps`
- `expected`
- `actual`

If any field is missing, ask only for missing fields and stop until complete.

## Fresh Branch Rule

- This flow has no implicit continuation mode.
- Create the bug intake artifact before deriving branch identity.
- For every new bug, derive `feature_id = lens-core-bugfix-{bug_slug}` and `feature_slug = lens-core-bugfix-{bug_slug}` from the `slug` returned by `bug-reporter-ops.py create-bug`.
- Because `bug_slug` includes a content hash, distinct bug reports produce distinct branch identities even when their titles are similar.
- Do not reuse the previous `working_branch`, active branch, or PR from the current conversation.
- If the user explicitly asks to continue a named existing bugfix branch or PR, continue only when that branch starts with `feature/lens-core-bugfix-`; otherwise stop with `branch_scope_mismatch`.
- If `prepare-dev-branch` reports `reused: true` for a new bug artifact (`status: created`), stop with `branch_reuse_blocked` unless the reused branch exactly matches `feature/{feature_id}` and is known to belong to the same `bug_slug`.

## On Activation

1. Ensure prompt-start preflight already succeeded.
2. Resolve:
   - `governance_repo = {project-root}/TargetProjects/lens/lens-governance`
   - `target_project = {project-root}/TargetProjects/lens-dev/new-codebase/lens.core.src`
   - `legacy_project = {project-root}/TargetProjects/lens-dev/old-codebase/lens.core.src`
3. Create bug intake artifact:

```bash
uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/scripts/bug-reporter-ops.py create-bug \
  --title "{title}" \
  --description "{description}\n\nRepro Steps:\n{repro_steps}\n\nExpected:\n{expected}\n\nActual:\n{actual}" \
   --source "lens-core-bugfix" \
  --chat-log "Bug report submitted via /lens-core-bugfix." \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --queue QuickDev
```

4. Parse script JSON:
   - `status: created` or `status: duplicate` are both valid; continue.
   - Capture `slug` as `bug_slug` and `path` as `bug_artifact_path` for the PR-recording step and Output Contract.
   - Set `feature_id = lens-core-bugfix-{bug_slug}` and `feature_slug = lens-core-bugfix-{bug_slug}`.
   - On non-zero exit, stop and surface error.
5. Load and run `{project-root}/.github/skills/bmad-quick-dev/SKILL.md`.
6. Use this implementation intent exactly:

"Fix this Lens core bug report in `TargetProjects/lens-dev/new-codebase/lens.core.src`.
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Repro Steps: {repro_steps}
Expected: {expected}
Actual: {actual}

Required workflow in target project:
1) Prepare the working branch by executing this standard Lens git operation from the workspace root:
    ```bash
    uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-git-orchestration/scripts/git-orchestration-ops.py prepare-dev-branch \
       --repo {target_project} \
       --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
       --feature-id {feature_id} \
       --feature-slug {feature_slug} \
       --mode feature-id \
       --base-branch develop
    ```
    Capture `working_branch`, `created`, and `reused` from the JSON output and use `working_branch` for all subsequent target-repo validation, push, and PR steps. If this command exits non-zero, stop and surface the exact error.
   The command is mandatory because it checks out the base branch, pulls the base branch, and creates the fresh Core Bugfix working branch from `develop` for this bug. Do not replace it with narrative instructions or skip it when the target repo already appears to be on a usable branch.
   Do not create or switch to any git worktree as a workaround for `dirty_working_tree`, `pull_failed`, missing branch state, or any other `prepare-dev-branch` failure. The only valid implementation path is `{target_project}`.
   If `working_branch` does not start with `feature/lens-core-bugfix-`, stop with `branch_scope_mismatch`.
   If `reused` is true for a newly created bug artifact, stop with `branch_reuse_blocked` unless the reused branch exactly matches `feature/{feature_id}` and is known to belong to the same `bug_slug`.
2) Before implementing, identify the primary affected Lens command (`lens-core-bugfix`) and inspect the same command in `TargetProjects/lens-dev/old-codebase/lens.core.src` to understand legacy behavior and identify gaps. Use the same command name and closest matching prompt/skill/script entrypoint when available. If no legacy match exists, record that as a gap.
3) If the legacy comparison reveals large gaps that materially change expected behavior, workflow, or outputs, stop and use `vscode_askQuestions` to confirm user intent before implementing.
4) Implement the fix and run relevant validation.
5) Stage and commit the implementation changes in `{target_project}` with a conventional commit message. Commit is mandatory for this flow; do not leave the bugfix branch with uncommitted implementation changes.

STOP HERE. Do not push. Do not create a PR. Do not offer to push or create a PR. Return a brief implementation summary to the conductor and halt. Push, PR creation, and all closeout steps are performed exclusively by the conductor in step 8."

8) CONDUCTOR COMPLETION GATE — Do not delegate this step. Run every bullet immediately after `bmad-quick-dev` returns its summary. Do not wait for user input. Do not answer the user until this entire gate has been executed.

   Note: `bmad-quick-dev` step-05 always ends by "offering" to push/create a PR. That offer is superseded by this mandatory gate. Ignore the offer and proceed directly.

   Run this conductor completion gate before responding to the user. This gate is mandatory even if the delegate claims the work is complete:
   - Verify `working_branch` is non-empty and the target project is currently on `{working_branch}`.
   - Verify implementation evidence comes from `{target_project}` itself. Do not satisfy branch, commit, validation, push, or PR evidence from a sibling worktree or alternate clone.
   - Verify `working_branch` starts with `feature/lens-core-bugfix-`; otherwise stop with `branch_scope_mismatch`.
   - Run `git status --short`. If implementation changes remain unstaged or uncommitted, commit them with a conventional commit message before continuing. Do not include unrelated user changes; stop and surface the blocker if unrelated changes are mixed into the same worktree.
   - Verify a non-empty implementation commit exists for this run. If no implementation commit can be established, stop with `bugfix_no_changes`.
   - Run `git -C {governance_repo} status --short`. If this flow produced governance changes (for example bug artifact updates), stage, commit, and push those changes before continuing. Do not include unrelated user changes; stop and surface the blocker if unrelated changes are mixed.
   - Run `git -C {project-root} status --short`. If this flow produced control-repo changes that belong to the bugfix execution, stage, commit, and push those changes on the active branch before continuing. Do not include unrelated user changes; stop and surface the blocker if unrelated changes are mixed.
   - Run `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and capture the result as `commit hash`.
   - Re-run the standard Lens push command from the workspace root and verify the branch is pushed:
     ```bash
     uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-git-orchestration/scripts/git-orchestration-ops.py push \
        --repo {target_project} \
        --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
        --branch {working_branch}
     ```
     If this exits non-zero, stop and surface the exact error.
   - Verify `origin/{working_branch}` exists after push. If not, stop and surface the blocking error.
   - Verify governance and control repos are clean for changes introduced by this flow after required pushes complete.
   - Run the idempotent PR creation command from the workspace root, capture `pr_url`, and include it as `PR URL`. The command reuses an existing open PR when present:
     ```bash
     uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-git-orchestration/scripts/git-orchestration-ops.py create-pr \
       --repo {target_project} \
       --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
       --head {working_branch} \
       --base develop \
       --title "fix(lens-core): {title}" \
       --body "{bug_context_with_legacy_gap_notes_and_validation_summary}"
     ```
     If this command exits non-zero, run this fallback from the `{target_project}` directory:
     ```bash
     gh pr create \
       --base develop \
       --head {working_branch} \
       --title "fix(lens-core): {title}" \
       --body "{bug_context_with_legacy_gap_notes_and_validation_summary}"
     ```
     Capture the PR URL from whichever command succeeds. Do NOT ask the user to create the PR themselves.
   - If `pr_url` is empty after both attempts, stop and surface `pr_creation_failed`.
   - Run `record-quickdev-pr` with `bug_slug` and the final `pr_url`, capture the returned `path`, and use it as `bug_artifact_path`:
     ```bash
     uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/scripts/bug-reporter-ops.py record-quickdev-pr \
       --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
       --slug {bug_slug} \
       --pr-url "{pr_url}"
     ```
   - Run `close-quickdev-bug` with `bug_slug`, a concise change summary, and validation summary. Capture the returned `path` as the final `bug_artifact_path`, and verify it points under `bugs/Fixed/`:
     ```bash
     uv run --script lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/scripts/bug-reporter-ops.py close-quickdev-bug \
       --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
       --slug {bug_slug} \
       --summary "{concise_change_summary}" \
       --validation-summary "{validation_summary}"
     ```
   - If the user requested automatic completion after the dev cycle, invoke `lens-complete` after the target PR is recorded. The conductor must run `complete-ops.py finalize --control-repo {project-root} --confirm` for the active feature, commit and push governance archival changes, and include the completion result or structured blocker in the final response.
   - For automatic completion requests, switch the control repo to `{feature_id}-dev` before the completion handoff and rely on `complete-ops.py` to validate related branches, create and merge the `{feature_id}-dev` → `main` PR, and delete related control branches after merge.
   - Do not answer with the Output Contract until `working_branch`, `commit hash`, `PR URL`, and `bug_artifact_path` are all non-empty, the PR URL has been recorded in the bug artifact, the Core Bugfix closeout section documents the changes and validation, the bug artifact is under `bugs/Fixed/`, and the target repo has no uncommitted implementation changes.
   - Do not answer with the Output Contract if governance/control-repo changes created by this flow remain uncommitted or unpushed.
   - Never say "left uncommitted", "you can create the PR", or equivalent manual handoff language for this flow. Either complete commit/push/PR verification or surface the exact blocking command/error.

## Output Contract

Return:

- bug artifact path
- branch name
- commit hash
- PR URL
- concise change summary
- validation summary
