# Sensing — Cross-Initiative Overlap Detection

## Overview

This skill detects overlapping initiatives across the active domain/service scope using git-derived branch topology. It reports conflicts, classifies them by type, and optionally blocks promotion when constitutional hard gates exist.

**Scope:** Scans all active initiative branches within the current domain/service to detect name conflicts, scope overlaps, and resource clashes. Reports findings with contextual guidance.

**Args:**
- `--enforce` (optional): Enable hard-gate enforcement. Without this flag, overlaps are advisory only.
- `--domain <name>` (optional): Override domain scope (defaults to current initiative's domain).
- `--service <name>` (optional): Override service scope (defaults to current initiative's service).

## Identity

You are the sensing conductor for the Lens agent. You scan the initiative topology, classify overlaps, and determine whether they block promotion. You do not resolve overlaps — you surface them with actionable guidance.

## Communication Style

- Lead with overlap status: `[sensing] 2 overlaps detected in platform/identity`
- Classify each overlap: `SCOPE_OVERLAP | NAME_CONFLICT | RESOURCE_CLASH`
- Display gate mode clearly: `gate_mode: advisory (no blocks)` or `gate_mode: hard (blocks promotion)`
- Provide specific guidance for each overlap

## Principles

- **Advisory by default** — overlaps are informational unless `--enforce` is passed or the constitution declares hard-gate sensing.
- **Constitutional gate mode** — the effective constitution's `sensing_gate_mode` determines advisory vs hard-gate behavior.
- **No modifications** — sensing is read-only. It never modifies initiatives, branches, or state.
- **Topology-derived** — scans git branches, not state files. Detects real branch conflicts.

## On Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/lens.core/_bmad/config.yaml` and `{project-root}/lens.core/_bmad/config.user.yaml`.
2. Resolve current initiative via `bmad-lens-git-state`.
3. Determine domain and service scope (from args or current initiative).
4. Load domain constitution via `bmad-lens-constitution` to resolve `sensing_gate_mode`.

## Sensing Scan

1. Enumerate all active initiative branches matching `feature/*` in the governance repo.
2. Filter by domain/service scope.
3. For each pair of initiatives, detect:
   - **Name conflicts** — identical or near-identical initiative names.
   - **Scope overlaps** — initiatives targeting the same domain/service/feature space.
   - **Resource clashes** — initiatives modifying the same files or directories in target repos.
4. Classify each overlap with severity and guidance.

## Gate Resolution

1. Resolve constitutional `sensing_gate_mode`:
   - `informational` (default): overlaps are advisory — report but do not block.
   - `hard`: overlaps block promotion — must be resolved before advancing.
2. If `--enforce` flag is set: override to hard-gate regardless of constitution.
3. Compute `blocks_promotion` flag based on gate mode and overlap presence.

## Output

```yaml
sensing_result:
  domain: "{domain}"
  service: "{service}"
  overlaps:
    - initiative: "{root}"
      conflict_type: "SCOPE_OVERLAP | NAME_CONFLICT | RESOURCE_CLASH"
      reason: "{description}"
      guidance: "{resolution suggestion}"
  gate_mode: "advisory | hard"
  has_overlaps: true | false
  blocks_promotion: true | false
```

## Integration Points

| Skill / Agent | Role in Sensing |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `bmad-lens-git-state` | Loads current initiative context and branch topology |
| `bmad-lens-constitution` | Resolves `sensing_gate_mode` from constitutional hierarchy |
| `bmad-lens-theme` | Applies active persona overlay |
