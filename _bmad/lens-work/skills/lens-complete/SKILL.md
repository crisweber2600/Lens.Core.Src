# Feature Completion

## Overview

This skill defines the lifecycle endpoint for Lens features. It checks whether a feature is ready to close, finalizes the archive when the user explicitly confirms, and reports whether a feature is already archived. The implementation is intentionally script-backed: prompts and agents explain the contract and run `scripts/complete-ops.py`; they never mutate governance state inline.

Act as a careful lifecycle archivist. Preserve the governance record, make irreversible actions explicit, and prefer structured JSON results over prose-only summaries.

## Operating Model

- `check-preconditions` is read-only and returns `pass`, `warn`, or `fail`.
- `finalize` is write-capable and irreversible; it must support dry-run mode and require explicit confirmation before writing.
- `archive-status` is read-only and returns the current archive state.
- Missing optional prerequisite artifacts degrade to warnings, not hard failures.
- Phase guard failures are blockers.
- All governance writes are performed by `scripts/complete-ops.py` using atomic file writes. Agents must not patch governance files directly.

## On Activation

1. Load Lens config from `{project-root}/lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/bmadconfig.yaml`.
2. If `{project-root}/.lens/governance-setup.yaml` exists and defines `governance_repo_path`, prefer it for `{governance_repo}`.
3. Resolve `{feature_id}` from the user request or active Lens context. If neither is available, ask for it.
4. Resolve `{governance_repo}`. If unavailable, stop with `config_missing`.
5. Resolve the script path: `{project-root}/lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-complete/scripts/complete-ops.py`.
6. If the script is absent, stop with `runtime_missing` and explain that the installed module is incomplete; do not simulate the operation.

## Command Contract

### check-preconditions

Validates that a feature can be finalized.

Inputs:

- `--governance-repo <path>`: governance repo root.
- `--feature-id <id>`: feature identifier.
- `--dry-run`: optional; accepted for callers that always pass dry-run flags. No writes are performed either way.

Guards:

- Feature must exist in governance.
- `feature.yaml.phase` must be in a completable state: `dev` or `dev-complete`; already terminal phases are reported by `archive-status`.
- **`retrospective.md` is a blocking prerequisite** (not advisory): the file MUST exist in the feature docs folder. If absent, return `status: fail` with `blocker: retrospective_missing` and a message directing the user to run `lens-retrospective` first. This check may not be downgraded to a warning.
- **`retrospective.md` status must be `approved`**: the file's YAML frontmatter `status` field MUST equal `approved`. If the file exists but `status` is not `approved`, return `status: fail` with `blocker: retrospective_not_approved` and the current status value.
- Missing document-project output is advisory and returns `status: warn` with `document_project_skipped: true`.
- Malformed governance YAML or an unsupported phase returns `status: fail`.

Return shape:

```json
{
  "status": "pass|warn|fail",
  "feature_id": "lens-dev-new-codebase-example",
  "phase": "dev-complete",
  "retrospective_skipped": false,
  "document_project_skipped": false,
  "checks": [
    {"name": "phase", "status": "pass", "message": "Feature is completable"},
    {"name": "retrospective", "status": "pass", "message": "retrospective.md exists and status is approved"}
  ],
  "warnings": [],
  "blockers": []
}
```

Failure shape when retrospective is missing:

```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "blocker": "retrospective_missing",
  "message": "retrospective.md is required before completing a feature. Run 'lens-retrospective' to create it, then set status: approved."
}
```

Failure shape when retrospective exists but is not approved:

```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "blocker": "retrospective_not_approved",
  "retrospective_status": "<current-status>",
  "message": "retrospective.md exists but status is not 'approved'. Update the file and set status: approved before completing."
}
```

Invocation:

```bash
$PYTHON ./scripts/complete-ops.py check-preconditions \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {feature_id}
```

### finalize

Archives a feature after confirmation.

Inputs:

- `--governance-repo <path>`: governance repo root.
- `--feature-id <id>`: feature identifier.
- `--dry-run`: preview planned changes without writing.
- `--confirm`: required for non-dry-run execution in non-interactive contexts.
- `--control-repo <path>` *(optional)*: path to the control repo. When provided, switches to `{featureId}-dev`, validates that related branches are already merged (`{featureId}-plan` into `{featureId}`, then `{featureId}` into `{featureId}-dev`), creates and merges a PR from `{featureId}-dev` to `main`, and deletes `{featureId}-plan`, `{featureId}`, and `{featureId}-dev` after the merge. Requires `gh` CLI to be authenticated. If the merge or cleanup fails, governance writes are **not** rolled back — the failure is surfaced as a warning in the response.

Confirmation gate:

Before non-dry-run execution, display the planned changes and require an explicit `yes` or `--confirm`. The summary must include the current phase, target phase, feature-index status change, summary path, and any skipped optional artifact warnings. If the user does not confirm, return `status: cancelled` and perform no writes.

Operations:

1. Run `check-preconditions` and require `pass` or `warn`. A `fail` status from any blocking check (including missing or unapproved retrospective) aborts finalize immediately.
2. Update `feature.yaml.phase` to `complete` and set `completed_at`.
3. Update the matching `feature-index.yaml` entry to `status: archived` and set `updated_at`.
4. Write `summary.md` if absent, or update only the generated archive section if a managed section exists.
5. If `--control-repo` is given, switch to `{featureId}-dev`, validate related branch ancestry, push it, create and merge a PR from `{featureId}-dev` to `main`, validate the dev branch reached `main`, then delete `{featureId}-plan`, `{featureId}`, and `{featureId}-dev` locally and on origin. An existing merged PR is treated as success. A merge or cleanup failure is non-fatal (warning only).
6. Return all applied changes in structured JSON.

Dry-run return shape:

```json
{
  "status": "dry_run",
  "feature_id": "lens-dev-new-codebase-example",
  "planned_changes": [
    {"path": "features/lens-dev/new-codebase/example/feature.yaml", "change": "phase -> complete"}
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

Execute return shape:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "feature_id": "lens-dev-new-codebase-example",
  "archived_at": "2026-04-30T00:00:00Z",
  "changes_applied": [
    {"path": "features/lens-dev/new-codebase/example/feature.yaml", "change": "phase -> complete"}
  ],
  "retrospective_skipped": false,
  "document_project_skipped": false
}
```

Invocations:

```bash
$PYTHON ./scripts/complete-ops.py finalize \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {feature_id} \
  --dry-run

$PYTHON ./scripts/complete-ops.py finalize \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {feature_id} \
  --confirm

# With control-repo merge ({featureId}-dev -> main):
$PYTHON ./scripts/complete-ops.py finalize \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {feature_id} \
  --control-repo {project-root} \
  --confirm
```

### archive-status

Reports archive state without writing.

Inputs:

- `--governance-repo <path>`: governance repo root.
- `--feature-id <id>`: feature identifier.

Return shape:

```json
{
  "status": "pass",
  "feature_id": "lens-dev-new-codebase-example",
  "archived": true,
  "phase": "complete",
  "index_status": "archived",
  "completed_at": "2026-04-30T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Invocation:

```bash
$PYTHON ./scripts/complete-ops.py archive-status \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {feature_id}
```

## Prerequisite Handling Decision

Graceful degradation applies only to optional project-documentation output. A missing or unapproved retrospective is a lifecycle blocker and must stop completion.

Hard blockers are limited to state and integrity failures:

- Feature not found.
- `feature.yaml` or `feature-index.yaml` cannot be parsed.
- Current phase is not completable.
- Required retrospective is missing or not approved.
- Required confirmation is absent for a non-dry-run finalize.
- Atomic write fails.

## Governance Discipline

- Always pull governance `main` before reading state.
- Never create governance branches.
- Never edit governance files with an agent patch or prompt body.
- After `finalize` writes governance state, commit and push immediately:

```bash
git -C {governance_repo} pull --rebase origin main
git -C {governance_repo} add feature-index.yaml features/
git -C {governance_repo} commit -m "[COMPLETE] {feature_id} - archive feature"
git -C {governance_repo} push origin main
```

If push fails because remote state changed, stop and surface the git error. Do not re-run `finalize` automatically.

## Error Contract

All operations return structured JSON on failure:

```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "feature_id": "lens-dev-new-codebase-example",
  "error": "wrong_phase",
  "message": "Feature phase is preplan; expected dev, dev-complete, or complete.",
  "blockers": ["phase"]
}
```

Known error codes:

- `config_missing`
- `feature_not_found`
- `feature_yaml_malformed`
- `feature_index_malformed`
- `wrong_phase`
- `confirmation_required`
- `write_failed`
- `runtime_missing`

## Test Contract

The tests in `scripts/tests/test-complete-ops.py` define the executable regression contract for `complete-ops.py`, including precondition checks, finalize writes, archive-status behavior, `{featureId}-dev` to `main` PR automation, branch ancestry validation, and related-branch cleanup.

Focused validation for the scaffold:

```bash
$PYTHON -m pytest {project-root}/lens.core/_bmad/lens-work/skills/lens-complete/scripts/tests/test-complete-ops.py -q
```
